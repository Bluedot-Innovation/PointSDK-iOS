PointSDK v15.6.0 (77)
# SDK Version 15.6.0

This SDK version primarily focuses on collecting more information about the SDK's lifecycle and how users interact with it. 

## What does it mean?

It means that with this version, weâ€™re going to have the data to start providing more useful and insightful  information about the end-users journeys. The additional data will also help us to keep improving our SDK. 

## What data are we collecting?

We're collecting data exclusively to the lifecycle of the SDK, such as:

- When the SDK is initiated.
- When the SDK is reset.
- When the SDK is running with Blue Bar (iOS only).
- When the Geo-triggering services start and stop.
- The minimum Apple OS required for the app to run.
- More detailed information about the location permissions granted to the SDK.

## What comes next?

The iOS SDK 15.6.0 release is a "stepping stone" that helps us continue releasing new features and products based on this data. Look forward to being able to visualise your user base with new data features coming out soon!
