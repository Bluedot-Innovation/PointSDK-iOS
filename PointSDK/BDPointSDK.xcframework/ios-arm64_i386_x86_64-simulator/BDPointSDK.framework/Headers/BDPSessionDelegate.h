/**
 Defines a delegate for handling <b>Point SDK</b>'s session related callbacks

 <b>Point SDK</b> needs to authenticate with <b>Canvas</b> to function.
 Applications must observe the correct authentication lifecycle when using <b>Point SDK</b> features, as documented.

 For richer information about the authentication lifecycle, applications may optionally assign an implementation of this
 protocol to the sessionDelegate property of the shared `BDLocationManager instance.
