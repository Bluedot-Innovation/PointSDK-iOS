/**
  @brief Defines a delegate for handling <b>Point SDK</b>'s session related callbacks

  <p><b>Point SDK</b> needs to authenticate with <b>Point Access</b> to function.
  Applications must observe the correct authentication lifecycle when using <b>Point SDK</b> features, as documented.</p>

  <p>Authentication state changes are most simply observed via the
  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/Articles/KVOCompliance.html">KVO-compliant</a>
  BDLocationManager.sessionDelegate.authenticationState property.</p>

  <p>For richer information about the authentication lifecycle, applications may optionally assign an implementation of this
  protocol to the sessionDelegate property of the shared BDLocationManager instance.</p>
