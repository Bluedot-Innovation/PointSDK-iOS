  <p>Assign your own implementation of this protocol to the @ref BDLocationManager#locationDelegate "locationDelegate" property of the
  shared @ref BDLocationManager instance, to handle location related callbacks.</p>

  <p>Callbacks inform the application when:
  <ul>
  <li>...new Zones have been received from <b>Point Access</b></li>
  <li>...the user has triggered a <b>Custom Notification</b> action</li>
  </ul>
