/**
  @brief Open-ended geometry consisting of two or more @ref BDPoint "points" connected by straight-line segments.

  Unlike a @ref BDPolygon "polygon" this geometry is open-ended and has no area.

  When used as a @ref BDFence "fence" geometry, @ref BDLineString is typically used to represent a geographic boundary or
  check-point along a road or other travel path.
